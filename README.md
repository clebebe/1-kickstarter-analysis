# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to be able to visualize how campaigns for plays have performed based on their launch date and funding goal amounts.


## Analysis and Challenges
There were no challenges in modifying the Excel data and creating charts out of the data. There may have been a difficulty utilizing countifs formula if I wasn't already familiar with it, particularly because it required multiple "if" statements than just one. I think there also may have been a difficulty grouping the pivot tables into months since default on my program was years. I believe it's a bit more difficult to find out that the years were "grouped" and that you can switch into other timelines i.e. months.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
!(Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
Above graph illustrates that the proporation between successful and failed theater campaigns have generally stayed constant througout the years. There were high numbers of campaigns launched during the months May, June, and July while winter months have had lower number of campaign launches.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Above chart illustrates how the campaigns have performed depending on the funding goal amounts. The general trend seems like campaigns are more succesasful if the funding goals are under $15,000, orbetween $35,000 and $44,000. However, we can see from the analyzed that that there are only 9 campaigns launched for the funding goal amount of $35,000-$44,999 while campaigns with funding goal less than $15,000 were close to 1,000 in nunber. Looking at the count of the projects relative to the successful and failed campaigns for each funding goals, it shows that this graph is not a great chart to determine how to set a funding amount for a campaign. However, it does provide the general trend that play campaigns perform better with lower funding goal amounts.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
